- Challenges
    - React Router not easy to configure w/ material-ui
        -Solved router issue, had to really examine the material ui code, I was trying to link the mobile render code and that's why there was issues.
    - Making the react router dynamic for specific products, taking hours to make each product page to work, the link is showing the current route, but the page isn't loading diffrent product information. It's very frustrating. 
        - Finally able to get each page to render different product names but now I am having a hard time passing props from app js to this specific component
        - Found a solution on stackoverflow on how to pass props, but now the issuse that I am having is that, I am having a hard time trying to dynamically render the product detail for different products.
    -First time using useeffect
    - Getting the total price to reflect the quantities in the cart

- Learned
    - When a useState is wrapped in a useEffect it can cause an infinite re-render
    - Using mock data on differnt components to make development easy(decouple).

- Talking points
    - Felt like endless to-dos
