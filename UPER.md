<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

-   U = "Understand"
-   P = "Plan"
-   E = "Execute"
-   R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
Create an inventory management system for the business of my choice. The focus will be the User Interface which allows a consumer to view available items, purchase any quantity of the merchandise and search for products on the site while maintaining the current state of the inventory.
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
My plan of action is to code the functionality of the appropriate pages, create a wireframe of the design that I would like to implement for the result, and then code the design/style aspect last. I am choosing to work on the functionality first because if I had to make a change and implement a new function there is a chance that I could mess up my design. The design should be fine-tuned to support functionality in the best way.

Regarding the architecture of the system, I plan to manage the state locally as well as creating a way for consumers to know that a product is sold out/not available.

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
Carry out the necessary steps, one code at a time!

    4. Reflection / Refactor
